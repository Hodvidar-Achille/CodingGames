Same solution but BigDecimal replace all double.

Still only 9/10 tests OK.

Next solution would be to use Interval that can know if left or right part is open or close.

Or we just need to use always km/h speed for calculations 
and therefore we will see when the interval is under the 1 km/h threshold (to ignore too narrow intervals) ?
